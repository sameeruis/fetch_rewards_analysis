**Slack Message:**

Hi Team,

I’ve completed my analysis of the Fetch Rewards dataset. Here’s a quick summary:

---

### **Key Data Quality Issues**:
1. Some transactions (around 5%) had missing barcodes, mainly from Aldi. These rows were flagged for further review.
2. Unrealistic age values (-1 and 125) were replaced with the median age (~40) to maintain consistency.

---

### **Interesting Trend**:
- **Health & Wellness** is the top product category, with Baby Boomers (46%) and Gen X (34%) leading purchases. Millennials (17%) show lower engagement in this category, suggesting opportunities for targeted strategies.

---

### **Action Needed**:
1. Can we confirm why barcodes are missing for Aldi transactions?
2. Do we have additional context on Walmart’s sales decline between June and September?

Let me know if you have any questions or need more details!

Thanks,  
Sameer
